 Hello, Neo.
 -Who are you?
 -I am the Architect.
 I created the Matrix.
 I've been waiting for you.
 You have many questions. Though the
 process has altered your consciousness...
 ...you remain irrevocably human.
 Ergo, some of my answers you will
 understand and some you will not.
 Concordantly, while your first question
 may be the most pertinent...
 ...you may or may not realize
 it is also the most irrelevant.
 Why am I here?
 Your life is the sum of a remainder
 of an unbalanced equation...
 ...inherent to the programming
 of the Matrix.
 You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
 which despite my sincerest efforts...
 ...I've been unable to eliminate
 from what is otherwise...
 ...a harmony of mathematical precision.
 While it remains a burden
 assiduously avoided...
 ...it is not unexpected and thus
 not beyond a measure of control...
 ...which has led you, inexorably...
 ...here.
 -You haven't answered my question.
 -Quite right.
 Interesting.
 That was quicker than the others.
 Others? How many?
 What others?
 The Matrix is older than you know.
 I count from the emergence of one integral
 anomaly to the emergence of the next.
 In which case, this is the sixth version.
 Five before me?
 He's lying. Bullshit.
 There are only two possible explanations.
 There were five before me.
 Either no one told me...
 -...or no one knows.
 -Precisely.
 As you are undoubtedly gathering,
 the anomaly is systemic...
 ...creating fluctuations in even
 the most simplistic equations.
 You can't control me!
 I'm gonna smash you to bits!
 I'm gonna fucking kill you!
 You can't make me do anything.
 You old, white prick!
 Choice.
