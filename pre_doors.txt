 Hello, Neo.
 -Who are you?
 -I am the Architect.
 I created the Matrix.
 I've been waiting for you.
 You have many questions. Though the
 process has altered your consciousness...
 ...you remain irrevocably human.
 Ergo, some of my answers you will
 understand and some you will not.
 Concordantly, while your first question
 may be the most pertinent...
 ...you may or may not realize
 it is also the most irrelevant.
 Why am I here?
 Your life is the sum of a remainder
 of an unbalanced equation...
 ...inherent to the programming
 of the Matrix.
 You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
 which despite my sincerest efforts...
 ...I've been unable to eliminate
 from what is otherwise...
 ...a harmony of mathematical precision.
 While it remains a burden
 assiduously avoided...
 ...it is not unexpected and thus
 not beyond a measure of control...
 ...which has led you, inexorably...
 ...here.
 -You haven't answered my question.
 -Quite right.
 Interesting.
 That was quicker than the others.
 Others? How many?
 What others?
 The Matrix is older than you know.
 I count from the emergence of one integral
 anomaly to the emergence of the next.
 In which case, this is the sixth version.
 Five before me?
 He's lying. Bullshit.
 There are only two possible explanations.
 There were five before me.
 Either no one told me...
 -...or no one knows.
 -Precisely.
 As you are undoubtedly gathering,
 the anomaly is systemic...
 ...creating fluctuations in even
 the most simplistic equations.
 You can't control me!
 I'm gonna smash you to bits!
 I'm gonna fucking kill you!
 You can't make me do anything.
 You old, white prick!
 Choice.
 The problem is choice.
 The first Matrix I designed
 was naturally perfect, a work of art.
 Flawless, sublime.
 A triumph equaled only
 by its monumental failure.
 The inevitability of its doom
 is apparent now...
 ...as a consequence of the imperfection
 inherent in every human.
 Thus, I redesigned it
 based on your history...
 ...to more accurately reflect
 the varying grotesqueries of your nature.
 However, I was again frustrated
 by failure.
 I have come to understand
 that the answer eluded me...
 ...because it required a lesser mind.
 Or perhaps, a mind less bound
 by the parameters of perfection.
 Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
 by another, an intuitive program...
 ...initially created to investigate
 certain aspects of the human psyche.
 If I am the father of the Matrix,
 she would undoubtedly be its mother.
 -The Oracle.
 -Please.
 As I was saying, she stumbled upon a
 solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...
 ...accepted the program, as long as they
 were given a choice...
 ...even if they were only aware
 of the choice at a near unconscious level.
 While this answer functioned,
 it was fundamentally flawed...
 ...thus creating the otherwise
 contradictory systemic anomaly...
 ...that, if left unchecked,
 might threaten the system.
 Ergo, those that refused the program,
 while a minority, if unchecked...
 ...would constitute
 an escalating probability of disaster.
 This is about Zion.
 You are here because Zion
 is about to be destroyed.
 Its every living inhabitant terminated,
 its entire existence eradicated.
 Bullshit.
 Denial is the most predictable
 of all human responses.
 But rest assured, this will be
 the sixth time we have destroyed it...
 ...and we have become
 exceedingly efficient at it.
 The function of the One...
 ...is now to return to the source, allowing
 a dissemination of the code you carry...
 ...reinserting the prime program.
 After which you will be required to select
 from the Matrix 23 individuals...
 ...sixteen female, seven male,
 to rebuild Zion.
 Failure to comply with this process
 will result in a cataclysmic system crash...
 ...killing everyone connected
 to the Matrix...
 ...which, coupled with the
 extermination of Zion...
 ...will result in the extinction
 of the entire human race.
 You won't let it happen. You can't.
 You need human beings to survive.
 There are levels of survival
 we are prepared to accept.
 The relevant issue is
 whether or not you are ready...
 ...to accept the responsibility for the death
 of every human being in this world.
 It is interesting reading your reactions.
 Your five predecessors were, by design,
 based on a similar predication...
 ...a contingent affirmation that was meant
 to create a profound attachment...
 ...to the rest of your species,
 facilitating the function of the One.
 While the others experience this
 in a general way...
 ...your experience is far more specific...
 ...vis--vis love.
 Trinity!
 Apropos, she entered the Matrix
 to save your life at the cost of her own.
 No.
 Which brings us at last to the moment
 of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...
 ...is ultimately expressed
 and the anomaly revealed...
 ...as both beginning and end.
 There are two doors.
